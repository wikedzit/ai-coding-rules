# Services:
- Services are used to perform the Business Logic for each endpoint.
- Services must be stored in the App/Services/Api folder.
- Model should dictate the fields that are required for the service.
- Services must be named like the model they are related to e.g. UserService.php
- Service will retuen paginated data if the model has pagination data otherwise it will return a single item.
- Use Laravel has built-in support for pagination. The best approach involves using Eloquentâ€™s paginate() method, which automatically structures the pagination data for JSON responses.
